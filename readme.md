# SongBird

SongBird is a simple CMS built using Symfony. The process of building this CMS is documented in [Practical Symfony 2.7](http://practicalsymfony.com) website.

I created this project to:

* Illustrate the power of rapid development with Symfony.

* Share the process of a simple CMS with anyone who wants to dive into Symfony. 

* Kickstart more complex Symfony projects with this bundle.

* Have fun!
