# SongBird

SongBird is a simple CMS built using Symfony. The process of building this CMS is documented in [Rapid Application Development With Symfony 2](http://practicalsymfony.com) website.

I created this project to:

* Illustrate the power of rapid development with Symfony.

* Share the process of a simple CMS with anyone who wants to dive into Symfony. 

* Kickstart more complex Symfony projects with this application.

* Have fun! 

To see the end product, checkout the chapter_20 branch.
